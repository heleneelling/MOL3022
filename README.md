# Prediciting Secondary Structure of a Protein

This program predicts the secondary structure of a protein sequence using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier.

## Prerequisites
This program requires the following packages to be installed:

- Biopython
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy

You can install them using pip:
```
python3 -m pip install biopython scikit-learn numpy
```

This should download all the necessary packages that are needed for the program to run.

## How to Run
Download the program file and save it to your desired location.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the program file and the data files.

Run the program by typing:
```
python working.py
```
*If this does not work, try using* :
```
python3 working.py
```

The predicted secondary structure for the test protein sequence and the accuracy score are printed in the terminal.


# Video
If these instructions were not clear enough, there is a video in the main file folder that shows how the code works, and how to run it. It also shows what is predicted.
